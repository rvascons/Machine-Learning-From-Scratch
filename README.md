# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
An example of how to make a Neural Network using just numpy

Here i coded a Neural Network from scratch using numpy:
  My input is a binary number in the format [x,x,x,x,x,x]
  The output is set in a way that: 1 = odd and 0 = even
  
Is a project that i did to get into the Machine Learning World, before getting into those complete libraries like TensorFlow.
Is a good way to understand how the things work behind the functions, if you want to learn more and get the basis i suggest that u start by:

      https://school.geekwall.in/p/Sy9NonT37/creating-a-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python, is from where i got my code, but with some changes, like building a new layer.
